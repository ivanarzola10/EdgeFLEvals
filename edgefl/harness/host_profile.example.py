"""Host profile: per-machine values the harness can't derive.

Copy this to host_profile.py (same dir) and edit for your machine. host_profile.py is
gitignored; this example is the committed template.

    cp edgefl/harness/host_profile.example.py edgefl/harness/host_profile.py

The harness imports host_profile.py, merges these with derived per-node identity and the
run config, and renders one .env per node.
