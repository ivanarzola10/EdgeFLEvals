# EdgeFL Large-Scale Evaluation Harness

Runs CFL/DFL federated-learning benchmarks at varying scale (Tiers of 5/10/15/30
Nodes) on a single machine, and writes per-Run result CSVs. Design decisions are in
`../platform_components/benchmarking/HARNESS_PLAN.md`.

Quick vocabulary: a **Node** is one participant (node_server + operator + Postgres); a
**Run** is one end-to-end benchmark execution; a **Config** is its parameter set
(mode, node count, rounds, ...); a **Tier** is a node-count band (5/10/15/30); the
**Harness** is this orchestration layer; the **Benchmarker** is the metrics pipeline
it consumes (`platform_components/benchmarking/`).

Validated end-to-end on Apple Silicon: 5-Node CFL/DFL (July 2026), and 10-Node CFL/DFL
(August 2026), AnyLog backend, MNIST. See `UPSTREAM_PR_NOTES.md` for what to reconcile
with [PR #105](https://github.com/royshadmon/EdgeFL/pull/105) before an upstream submission.

## One-time setup

1. **Docker Desktop** with **host networking enabled**
   (Settings → Resources → Network → "Enable host networking"). The AnyLog stack
   binds everything to 127.0.0.1 — no host networking means nothing can talk.
2. **AnyLog license + image + compose repo** — follow
   `AnylogNetworkSetup/AnyLog-Setup.md` sections 2–5:
   - `docker load < AnyLog-ARM.tar` (image `anylogco/anylog-network:ucsc-arm`)
   - clone `github.com/AnyLog-co/docker-compose`, branch `roy-local`, and apply the
     guide's config edits (Makefile TAG, `LICENSE_KEY=$ANYLOG_LICENSE` in
     `master-configs/base_configs.env`)
   - export `ANYLOG_LICENSE` from your shell profile. **An expired license shows up
     as the master idling with no processes** — check expiry first when nothing works.
3. **Python env** — the repo venv with `requirements.txt` plus
   `torch torchvision tensorflow scikit-learn python-dotenv uvicorn fastapi`.
4. **Host profile** — per-machine values:

   ```bash
   cp edgefl/harness/host_profile.example.py edgefl/harness/host_profile.py
   # edit GITHUB_DIR, ANYLOG_COMPOSE_DIR; PYTHON_BIN should point at the venv python
   ```

## Running

Everything is `python -m harness ...` from the `edgefl/` directory (venv active,
`ANYLOG_LICENSE` exported).

```bash
# Bring up master + N operators + N Postgres shards, then insert MNIST into each shard
python -m harness infra-up --nodes 5 --seed

# One Run against that infra (CFL here; results + logs land under harness/runs/)
python -m harness run --mode cfl --nodes 5 --rounds 10

# DFL (self-start + cold-start are implied by the mode)
python -m harness run --mode dfl --nodes 5 --rounds 10

# The default Config sweep across Tiers (full rebuild + reseed at each tier boundary)
python -m harness suite --tiers 5,10

# Print the plan + render env files, but launch nothing
python -m harness suite --tiers 5 --dry-run

# Stop containers (add --volumes to also wipe blockchain + Postgres data)
python -m harness infra-down --nodes 5
```

The default per-tier sweep lives in `tier_sweep()` in `__main__.py` — edit it there.

## What a Run produces

`edgefl/harness/runs/<utc-timestamp>_<run_id>_a<attempt>/`:

| artifact | meaning |
|---|---|
| `env/*.env` | the generated env file each server was launched with |
| `logs/*.log` | per-server stdout+stderr (uvicorn + training logs) |
| `results.csv` | raw `fl_benchmarks` rows for this run_id (long format) |
| `manifest.json` | config + status + reason + timings — the machine-readable record |

CSV columns: `node, training_index, round_number, metric_name, metric_value, time`
(+ AnyLog bookkeeping columns). `training_index` == `run_id` == the blockchain index,
so every run is isolated on-chain and in the results table.

Timing metrics recorded per round: `polling_time_s`, `training_time_s`,
`total_round_time_s` per node; `aggregation_time_s` (per DFL node, or `node_name=agg`
for CFL); `first_to_last_arrival_s` + `straggling_node_id` (CFL aggregator).
`round_accuracy` is the accuracy team's metric and appears when their inference
call-sites are active.

**DFL note:** DFL nodes never stop on their own — the harness tears down once all N
published a submodel at `total_rounds`, but rows for a few extra rounds usually land
in the CSV (the network keeps training during collection). Filter
`round_number <= total_rounds` when analyzing.

## How completion/failure is decided

- **CFL complete** — aggregator RoundStart reached `total_rounds` AND ≥ `min_params`
  submodels exist at that round (RoundStart alone only means the last round *started*).
- **DFL complete** — all N nodes published a submodel at `total_rounds` (unanimity).
- **FAILED_PROCESS_DEATH** — a server's Popen exited mid-run.
- **FAILED_TIMEOUT / FAILED_STALL** — wall clock (`--completion-timeout`, default
  1800s) or no ledger progress (`--no-progress-timeout`, default 300s).
- Failures still write a partial `results.csv`, then the run is retried once after a
  full infra rebuild (`--no-retry` disables). A second failure is recorded and the
  suite moves on.

## Backends

`host_profile.INFRA_BACKEND` selects the Docker stack:

- **`anylog`** (primary, validated) — drives the AnyLog-co/docker-compose Makefile,
  host networking, needs `ANYLOG_LICENSE`. The harness generates
  `docker-makefiles/operator<i>-configs/` from operator1's config for any node count.
  Every operator gets its **own CLUSTER_NAME** — operators sharing a cluster
  replicate each other's data, which silently breaks per-Node shard isolation (the
  hand-written operator2/3 demo configs share "NYC-branch"; don't copy that pattern).
- **`edgelake`** (open-source fallback, NOT fully working) — brings up containers and
  the master ledger fine, but the EdgeLake image's one-shot deployment script fails to
  self-configure operators (no DBMS connect, no Operator process; its policy push
  races container networking at boot and never retries). Known gap left for a future
  pass — see "Handoff" below. Config knobs for it (`DOCKER_INTERNAL_HOST`) are already
  plumbed.

## Troubleshooting

| symptom | likely cause |
|---|---|
| master up but no processes / operators can't sync | expired `ANYLOG_LICENSE` |
| `connection refused` to any 32X49 port | Docker Desktop host networking disabled |
| operator has no `mnist_fl` in `get databases` | Postgres shard not up, or wrong `DB_PORT` in its generated config |
| seed succeeds but `select count(*)` shows 0 | rows sit in partitions — query with `destination: network`, or check `get rows count where dbms = mnist_fl` (par_ tables) |
| `FAILED_SETUP: EdgeLake not ready` from `run` | bring infra up first: `python -m harness infra-up --nodes N` |
| run completes but CSV is thin | results settle-polling capped out; rerun collection manually via `harness.results.collect_run_csv` |
| an operator shows `Cluster Member: False` / duplicate-IP errors in `get error log` | stale duplicate `cluster-operator*` policies accumulated on the blockchain from repeated container restarts over time (AnyLog's own declare-policy step isn't idempotent). No in-place fix — `infra-down --volumes` + fresh `infra-up` clears it. Don't leave the stack running unattended for weeks; tear it down between sessions. |

Useful direct probes (any node, REST):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:32149 -H "User-Agent: AnyLog/1.23" -H "command: get processes"
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:32149 -H "User-Agent: AnyLog/1.23" -H "command: get databases"
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:32049 -H "User-Agent: AnyLog/1.23" -H "command: blockchain get <run_id>"
```

## Handoff — what's left (deliberately)

- **Hybrid runs** — config, env rendering, and completion predicate exist
  (`--mode hybrid --hybrid-centralized K`) but have never been executed; HARNESS_PLAN
  ordered hybrid last. Known caveat: which RoundStart a listener picks up each round
  is nondeterministic when both cohorts are publishing one — see the prereq note on
  step 9 in `HARNESS_PLAN.md`.
- **Tier 30 validation** — the machinery is tier-agnostic (ports/configs derive from
  the node index; tier-30 port math is collision-checked). Tiers 5, 10, and 15 have
  all run CFL+DFL clean on real hardware (Aug 2026); 30 is the plan's stretch tier,
  unvalidated. Watch RAM: each node_server loads TensorFlow.
- **EdgeLake backend** — see gap above. Options: drive operator config explicitly over
  REST (`connect dbms` + cluster/operator policies + `run operator`), or retry the
  image's deployment script once networking is up.
- **Plotting** — out of scope by decision; CSVs are long-format so a pandas/matplotlib
  layer can read past suites without re-running.
- **Datasets beyond MNIST** — the platform itself already supports this (data handlers
  are loaded dynamically via `MODULE_NAME`/`MODULE_FILE`; `chest_xrays_bbox` and
  `winniio` data handlers + env files already exist alongside MNIST's), but the
  harness's `datasets.py` registry only has an MNIST `DatasetProfile` wired up. Adding
  another is small: a new `DatasetProfile` entry (module name/file, logical db, train/
  test table names) plus a `seed.py` entry pointing at that dataset's insertion script.
  One wrinkle: `winniio_db_script.py` writes straight to Postgres with raw SQL rather
  than through AnyLog's REST insert like `store_data.py`/`chest_xrays_bbox_db_script.py`
  do, so wiring in Winniio specifically needs a slightly different `seed_operator` path,
  not just a registry line. chest_xrays_bbox would be the easier first addition — same
  REST-insert pattern as MNIST.
- **Failure thresholds as Config knobs, multi-person distributed runs** — future
  directions listed at the end of HARNESS_PLAN.md.
